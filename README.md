# CoinAndDragonGame
Simple CoinDragon Game using Python and Pygame.

About the game.

The player is just trying to get home but gather as much coins/gold as possible within a given time. Music and crash alerts are within the game to make it more fun.
If you pick a coin, you get 10 points but if you are caught by a dragon or fall in water, 10 points in the form of coin points are deducted/subracted from your accumulated coin score.
You pick a coin/gold by using the spacebar but an attempt to pick coin/gold from the GRASS results in points deducted as a way of educating people about illigal mining and its side effects on the land.
After time has elasped, if the player is still not at HOME, the game ends with a GAME OVER prompt.
